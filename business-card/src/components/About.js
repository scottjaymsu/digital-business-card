            <p>
                I am a junior at Michigan State University with a strong background in the natural sciences, specifically biochemistry. I best learn by focusing on gaining a conceptual understanding of content and learning specific details afterward. Also, I would consider myself an extroverted person that enjoys working with others and exchanging ideas.
